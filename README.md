# A bit more about me

During my studies in Mechanical engineering, I learned C-Sharp, while I also learned PowerShell at Vulkan's. It was this time that I realized I liked programming way more than engineering, so I switched. My experiences as a working student were so positive that I chose to take up a study-accompanying job.
I got the opportunity to work at Materna IPS, an aviation solutions company. Quite thrilling, as I like traveling and getting to know the background scenes and systems. I had to accept. As of today, I am glad that I did. I have already learned very much and am excited to continue. 

This is everything I can come up with, at the moment. Cheers!
